## Day-to-Day work
Check-ins after lunch and ensuring a commit everyday. Talk about what we did and how we did it. Talk about what we're doing each day. Communicating the process. Stand-up in the morning as well. 9:00am stand-up. One person to kick-it-off in the morning. Alternating each day.

# Conflict Plan

## Process for Conflict Resolution
Get back to the five man team and take a vote on issues. Communicate the conflict or vote through Slack. 

## Sharing and Contributions
Recognize the issues during the post lunch meeting. Rebalance after looking at the Git commit history.

## How will you deal with the Conflict?
Talk it out. Then go to Audrey.

## What hours will you be available to communicate?
Slack- all hours in play.

## How often will you take breaks?
Individual responsibility. In Remo turn camera off then take a break.

## What is the plan for falling behind?
Check at noon. If somebody doesn't have a commit we'll change our workflow. Collectively, if we're having issues we can reach out to Audrey.

## Ensuring everyone's voice is heard
If someone is not responsive, reaching out to them.

## Safe Environment
If someone is uncomfortable, reaching out to them. Part of the stand-up ask "Is there any big changes?" Anything to shake-up or change?
